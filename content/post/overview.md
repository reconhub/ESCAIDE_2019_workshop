Our two courses will be running in parallel ahead of ESCAIDE 2019 in Stockholm,
on the 25-26th November 2019. See the [practical information](../practical_info)
section for details on venue and timings.


## Course #1 /// Introduction to epidemiological analysis using R

### Outline

* **Level**: accessible to **R** beginners; see [pre-requisites](register) on
  the registration page.
* **Capacity**: 40 participants
* **Summary**: an introduction to using **R** for epidemiological analysis.


### Course content

A more detailed programme will be communicated closer to the event. The course
will include a mixture of lectures and hands-on practicals. The following topics
will be covered:

* introduction to **R** and *Rstudio*
* reading data from common formats (text files, Excel spreadsheets)
* introduction to graphics using *ggplot2*
* good practices for data science
* introduction to automated reports using *rmarkdown*
* hands on practical: the Stegen case study


Learning outcomes will include:

* understanding of **R** basics
* ability to structure a project
* use of RECON deployer
* ability to import and export data
* methods for fast data cleaning
* building meaningful graphics
* ability to use automated data analysis reports
* ability to generate simple tables and summaries
* basics statistics including risk ratios and Fisher's exact test
* ability to generate static, and interactive maps
* **R** packages used: *rio*, *ggplot2*, *rmarkdown*, *incidence*, *epitrix*, *dplyr*, *sf*




## Course #2 /// Advanced course: tools for emergency outbreak response

### Outline

* **Level**: aimed at regular / experienced **R** users; see
  [pre-requisites](register) on the registration page.
* **Capacity**: 20 participants
* **Summary**: an introduction to new **R** tools for emergency outbreak
  response, currently used by the Ebola analytical cell in North Kivu, DRC.
