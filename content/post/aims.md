The main aim of this three-day workshop will be to discuss the processes relating to the development and dissemination of data collection and analysis to support outbreak response and humanitarian health emergency activities in low and middle income countries (LMICs). 
 
We anticipate that the meeting will provide an opportunity for participants to share views and experiences during operations which will help to develop and foster partnerships across institutions and countries with a strong emphasis on leadership from partners in LMICs. Following presentations on day one we intend to hold workshops to further discuss and develop our ideas in relation to selected thematic areas.
 
By the end of this meeting, we plan to draft a report, review gaps, challenges and recommendations, as well as outline of a strategic roadmap for future projects and partnerships.
 
The meeting will be highly interactive and attendees will be representing a wide array of stakeholders including those from  non-governmental organisations, academia, Field-Epidemiology Training Programmes and funding bodies, all of which have a strong track record of supporting outbreak response and humanitarian health emergency activities.
