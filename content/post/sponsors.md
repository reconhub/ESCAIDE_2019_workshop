## UK Public Health Rapid Support Team

Through the UK Public Health Rapid Support Team (UK-PHRST), the UK has the capacity to respond rapidly to disease outbreaks in low- and middle-income countries around the world and conduct operational research into epidemic preparedness, playing an important role in global health security. The team also works to help countries to build their own capacity for an improved and rapid national response to outbreaks.

The UK-PHRST is funded by UK aid from the Department of Health and Social Care and is a partnership between the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and Public Health England (PHE). University of Oxford and King’s College London (KCL) are academic partners. The team’s Director is Professor Daniel Bausch. The UK-PHRST supports this meeting financially and logistically.

The R Epidemics Consortium ([RECON](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/xs)) is
international not-for-profit, non-governmental organisation gathering experts in
data science, modelling methodology, public health, operational epidemiology and software development to create the next generation of analytics tools for informing the response to
disease outbreaks, health emergencies and humanitarian crises, using the R

## The LSHTM-EDK
