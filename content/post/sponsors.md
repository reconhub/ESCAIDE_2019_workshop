## R Epidemics Consortium (RECON)

The R Epidemics Consortium ([RECON](https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/)) is
international not-for-profit, non-governmental organisation gathering experts in
data science, modelling methodology, public health, operational epidemiology and
software development to create the next generation of analytics tools for
informing the response to disease outbreaks, health emergencies and humanitarian
crises, using the R software and other free, open-source resources. RECON is
currently the largest initiative for the development of R packages for
epidemiological analysis. RECON packages are at the core of the current data
analytics pipelines used by WHO and partners in the response to the Ebola Virus
Disease outbreak in North Kivu, DRC.

wider epi community, including a number of short courses and workshops in
collaboration with RECON.





## NIHR-HPRU for modelling methodology

The [NIHR Health Protection Research Unit for Modelling
Methodology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hpru-modelling) (NIHR HPRU MM) is a
structural collaboration between Public Health England and Imperial College
London, the NIHR HPRU MM (HPRU-2012-10080) which was established in 2014 with
the aim of developing novel analytical and computational tools to improve public
health.

We thank the UK National Institute for Health Research Health Protection
