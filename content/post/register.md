## Application process

### How it works

Applications will be made through the application form at the end of this
page. Participants will be selected on a first arrived, first served basis. The
process will work as follows:

* participant sends an application using the provided form
* if room is available, payment details are sent to the participant; otherwise,
  participant is put on the waiting list
* final confirmation is sent when payment is received; if no payment is received
  within 7 days, the application will be considered cancelled


Note that the two courses will be run in parallel. **It is only possible to apply
to a single course.**


### Pre-requisites

#### Course #1 /// Introduction to epidemiological analysis using R

Basic knowledge of **R** is encouraged but not mandatory. We ask that
participants bring their own laptop, a travel adapter, and pre-install if possible: 

* the latest stable version of **R** installed, which can be downloaded from the
[R project website](https://www.r-project.org/).
* a code editor for **R**; if unsure, use
  [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* for *windows* users, we recommend installing the matching version of
  [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
* for *Mac OSX* users, a working version of
  [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12)



#### Course #2 /// Advanced course: tools for emergency outbreak response

Basic knowledge of **R** is mandatory for this course. This includes familiarity
with the following:

* basic classes of objects: `vector`, `matrix`, `data.frame`, `list` and how to
  subset them
* reading data into **R** from text files or Excel spreadsheets
* basic plotting system or *gglot2*
* finding documentation, including for generic/methods (e.g. `plot.incidence`)




### Pricing

### Deadlines
